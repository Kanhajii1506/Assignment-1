Task-1 
Solution :- HTML File

Task-2
Solution:- The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed or rendered in the browsers. You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date.
Example :- HTML File

Task-3
Solution :- HTML File

Task-4
Solution:- As part of an HTML element, HTML tags help web browsers convert HTML documents into web pages. For example, the <p> tag is used to organise text content into paragraph elements and the <img> tag is used to embed image elements. Many tags, though not all, use an opening tag and closing tag to wrap around the content that they are used to modify. Closing tags are denoted with a backslash like this: </tag_name>. HTML tags are not visible in the browser.

Example:- <p>This is the paragraph.</p>


Task-5
Solution:- The HTML document type declaration, also known as DOCTYPE, is the first line of code required in every HTML or XHTML document. The DOCTYPE declaration is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in. This ensures that the web page is parsed the same way by different web browsers.
